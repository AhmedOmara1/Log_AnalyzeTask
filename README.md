# Log File Analysis Tool

This project provides scripts for analyzing web server log files. Two versions are included to support both Windows (PowerShell) and Unix/Linux (Bash) environments.

## Features

The log analyzer generates a comprehensive report that includes:

1. **Basic Request Statistics**
   - Total requests count
   - Count of GET requests
   - Count of POST requests

2. **Unique IP Analysis**
   - Number of unique IP addresses
   - Request counts per IP (total, GET, POST)

3. **Error Analysis**
   - Count of failed requests (4xx and 5xx status codes)
   - Percentage of failed requests
   - Days and hours with highest failure rates

4. **Traffic Patterns**
   - Daily request averages
   - Hourly request distribution
   - Status code distribution

5. **User Behavior**
   - Most active IP addresses
   - Most active IP for GET requests
   - Most active IP for POST requests

6. **Analysis Suggestions**
   - Recommendations based on the findings
   - Security considerations
   - System improvement recommendations

## Usage

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
.\log_analyzer.ps1
```

### Unix/Linux (Bash)

```bash
chmod +x log_analyzer.sh
./log_analyzer.sh
```

## Requirements

### Windows
- PowerShell 5.0 or higher

### Unix/Linux
- Bash shell
- Common Unix utilities: grep, awk, sort, uniq, bc

## Output

Both scripts generate a detailed report file in the same directory as the script.

## Log Format

The scripts are designed to work with standard web server log formats (Apache, Nginx) that include:
- IP address
- Date and time
- Request method (GET, POST)
- URL
- HTTP status code
- User agent information

Example log entry:
```
83.149.9.216 - - [17/May/2015:10:05:03 +0000] "GET /presentations/logstash-monitorama-2013/images/kibana-search.png HTTP/1.1" 200 203023 "http://semicomplete.com/presentations/logstash-monitorama-2013/" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/32.0.1700.77 Safari/537.36"
```

## GitHub Repository

The code is available on GitHub with all the necessary scripts and examples:

1. Main scripts:
   - `log_analyzer.ps1`: Full PowerShell implementation
   - `log_analyzer.sh`: Full Bash implementation


2. Sample output files:
   - `log_analysis_report.txt`: Generated by the PowerShell script

### Setting up the repository:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/log-file-analyzer.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd log-file-analyzer

# Make the bash scripts executable (if needed)
chmod +x *.sh

# Run the analysis
./log_analyzer.sh
```
